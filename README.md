# Secure-communication-using-chaos

The study of secure communication using chaos was done as a part of the course project in Non Linear Dynamics (PH 542).

lorenz.m - Simulation of the Lorenz system  
Lorenz_message.m - Code for communicating a bit pulse  
Lorenz_signal.m - Code for communicating an audio signal securely using chaotic masking   

Rossler.m - Simulation of the Rossler system   
Rossler_signal.m - Code for communicating an audio signal securely using chaotic masking
